[err]
1. Critical p, q. (fixed)
2. An entire graph seemingly missing in ppqrs>qrs/2
3. An entire TYPE of graphs (with three subtypes) missing in ppqrs>qrs/2
   note: This is actually critical, because it would seem that they yield counterexamples.
   It is still not clear how I should approach them.


[arg]
1. If we have ppqrs, with q -> r -> s and r ---w---> pp, then the usual argument forces q = 3.
     However, we end up with an arrow of some sort from q in this case!
2. O_{2/3} is actually inadmissible. That's because it is composed of M2 and something else.


[ext]
1. Consider extending the main splicing lemma for \Gamma with non-terminal q.
2. Clear up the confusion in sqf case 2 (the b --> Q bit).
3. In which cases is a graph extensible by 1? Either by adding a vertex or some other operation.
4. Generally, make a dedicated study of operations on graphs and how they change it, beginning
from minor ones like removing an edge, etc. Consider variants like central subsets.
